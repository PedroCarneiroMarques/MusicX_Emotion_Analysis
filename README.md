MusicX Mental Health Project
Overview: This documentation aims to provide insights into the correlation between music preferences and self-reported mental health. Collected data spans responses from 737 individuals regarding music genre preferences and self-reported mental health issues.

Data Overview
Description: The dataset comprises self-reported responses on music genre preferences and mental health symptoms. It includes 737 entries and features columns such as music genre frequencies, mental health ratings for Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD, and demographics like Age and Hours per day listening to music.

Methodology
Process: Initial steps included preprocessing by converting categorical frequency values into numeric representations. Feature engineering was performed by creating a 'TotalMusicFreq' feature from frequency columns. The dataset was split into training and testing sets for machine learning model creation

Libraries Used
Listing: Primary tools used involve Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, Streamlit for the app interface, and Plotly for data visualization purposes.

Findings and Conclusion
Insights: Initial analysis reveals potential associations between certain music genre frequencies and reported mental health symptoms. Further investigation is needed to establish causal relationships.

Future Work
Prospects: Future directions involve deeper analysis using more sophisticated models or conducting surveys to gather more diverse data. Incorporating qualitative data or conducting longitudinal studies could provide richer insights.
